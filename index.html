            <p class="px1">Tired of people talking over you? Ignoring your input? Or mistaking you for an assistant? We understand. Ideally, whether you are taken seriously or not does not depend on your race, or gender. In fact, we hope to one day arrive in a world where this service would be completely redundant. 
            </p><p class="px1">
            Until such time, this is our solution for an imperfect world: white, generic looking men to accompany you to your meetings and presentations. Their one and only job is to redirect focus to you, talk you up and interrupt your interrupters.</p>

            <p class="px1">However, don't assume either of these types holds any of the corresponding skills. Their only job is to redirect attention to you. If someone cuts you off mid-sentence, they will merely say something along the lines of, 'she was still speaking' so that you can go back to pitching your idea, or giving your opinion. </p>
            <p class="px1">All our men are volunteers. Please treat them with the respect they deserve.</p>

After that you'll be  ready to take as many appointments as you like, to help non-white males everywhere get their messages out!
