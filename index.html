            <p class="teal-dark intro px1" style="font-size:1.3rem;font-weight:700;">Sometimes all you need to get through a meeting is, for instance, a stereotypical white male to lend you their aura of authority and credibility.</p><p class="px1">Our volunteers are all people who'd like to use their privilege to make your life a little easier, without taking over. Our ultimate goal is to dismantle the patriarchy, but unfortunately that sometimes means we need to be able to navigate it first. This service helps with that.</p>

            <p class="px1">Tired of people talking over you? Ignoring your input? Underestimating your skills? We understand. Ideally, whether you are taken seriously or not does not depend on your race, or gender. In fact, we hope to one day arrive in a world where this service would be completely redundant.

            Until such time, this is our solution for an imperfect world: a bunch of privileged humans to accompany you to your meetings and presentations, court hearings and whatever else you come up with. Their one and only job is to redirect focus to you, talk you up and interrupt your interrupters.</p>

            <p class="px1">Are you willing to dress up in gender-conforming clothes and eager to put your privilege to good use? We're looking for you! </p>
            <p class="px1">Privilege can be derived from a great number of things: skin color, sex, understanding of specific jargon, social capital, wealth could all be sources of privilege, depending on your context. Our main role is to connect you to someone who has a need for your specific privilege.</p>
            <p class="px1">To become a volunteer you'll receive a day long training, during which you'll be made aware of your (unconscious) biases and learn how to function in a supporting role. After that you'll be  ready to take as many appointments as you like, to help those less-privileged get their messages out!
